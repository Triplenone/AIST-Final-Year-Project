# Family & Operations Web Dashboard

This folder contains a lightweight prototype of the responsive dashboard that brings the Smart Wearable
and Smart Elderly Care services together.

## Screens Included
- **Care Overview**: Daily wellbeing summary cards, recent alerts, and recommended interventions.
- **Resident Directory**: Searchable roster with quick access to vitals and notes.
- **Facility Operations**: Live occupancy view, scheduled activities, and maintenance reminders.
- **Family Engagement**: Messaging pane and visit planning timeline.

## Technology Preview
The prototype is built with static HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to validate layout and content structure.
In production this would evolve into a React/Next.js application while retaining the information architecture
and accessibility considerations demonstrated here.
