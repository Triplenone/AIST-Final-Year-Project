# Alert Orchestration Service Blueprint

## Responsibilities
- Consume telemetry streams and evaluate rule-based thresholds.
- Apply machine learning predictions to prioritize alerts.
- Coordinate notification channels (push, SMS, voice) with escalation policies.
- Maintain audit trail of alert lifecycle and caregiver acknowledgements.

## Technology Stack
- Python (Celery workers) for asynchronous workflows.
- Kafka consumer groups for scalable event processing.
- Twilio/FCM integrations for outbound communications.
- Elasticsearch for storing searchable alert history.

## Deployment Considerations
- SLA-driven autoscaling policies based on queue depth.
- Dead-letter queues for unprocessable events.
- Continuous testing of notification channels using synthetic monitors.
