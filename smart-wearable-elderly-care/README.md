- `frontend/`: Mobile and web applications for caregivers, family members, and residents.
- `infrastructure/`: Infrastructure-as-code, DevOps automation, and observability configurations.
- `data/`: Data engineering pipelines, AI/ML models, and analytics artifacts.
- `operations/`: Processes for deployment, compliance, and ongoing operations.

Refer to `docs/architecture-overview.md` for a detailed explanation of how these components interact. For a mapping between the proposal's objectives and this environment, see `docs/proposal-alignment.md`.
